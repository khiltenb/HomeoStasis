# HomeoStasis
A Linux, Raspberry Pi, and possibly Andriod based "Smart Home" system that will be able to manage house temperature, inventory, lighting, security, and other safety or maintenance-related concerns.

This project is not yet clearly defined, and will take a lot of brainstorming to even start to bring to fruition.
