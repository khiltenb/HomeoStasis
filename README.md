# HomeoStasis
A Linux, Raspberry Pi, and possibly Andriod based "Smart Home" system that will be able to manage house temperature, inventory, lighting, security, and other safety or maintenance-related concerns.

This project is not yet clearly defined, and will take a lot of brainstorming to even start to bring to fruition.

Now thinking of an integration with ZOWE (An open-source Z/OS based mainframe system) as well. Integration with this system may allow for greater information security and prevent crossing of information streams from systems like security, inventory, and temperature management. This kind of prevention could be ensured by a well constructed database, but having a second layer of protection isn't necessarily a bad thing. We'll see when we get to the development phase of this project.
